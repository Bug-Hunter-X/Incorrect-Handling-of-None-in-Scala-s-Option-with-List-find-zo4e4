# Incorrect Handling of None in Scala's Option with List.find

This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala when working with `Option` and `List.find`. The error arises from incorrectly handling the `None` case when searching for an element in a list.

The `bug.scala` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.scala` provides the corrected version.

## Problem Description

The problem lies in how the code handles the absence of a matching user.  If no user with the given ID is found, `List.find` returns `None`.  If this `None` is not properly handled, it can lead to runtime exceptions or unexpected results.

## Solution

The corrected code uses pattern matching (`match` statement) or the `orElse` method on `Option` to gracefully handle the `None` case. This prevents errors and ensures that the program behaves as expected, even when no user is found.

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering the `Option` type and its handling in Scala code.  Always ensure that you anticipate and handle the `None` case appropriately to avoid runtime errors and ensure program stability.
